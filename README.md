Text editor with the ability to format text (bold, italic text; select text size and font) and insert images. It is possible to export a document to various files. The editor can recognise markup language and replace formatting (supports Markdown). To develop this application, I needed to know basic Java syntax and data types, understand basic arithmetic operations, work with the user on data input/output, implement logic to determine the winner and JavaFx.
